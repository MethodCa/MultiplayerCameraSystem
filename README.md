# Multiplayer Camera System

Camera system for 2D multiplayer games that pan and zooms to maintain up to 4 players in camera. The system finds the X position where the camera should be positioned taking into account 4 players, this is done by finding the player that is situated at the most left, and most right and positioning the camera at the centre of them.
